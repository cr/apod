usage:  apod update|get|lock|unlock [<options> ...]

commands:
        update [<file> [<date>]]
             loads image to file, ~/apod.png if unspecified. Format of
             optional date is YYMMDD. If unspecified, today's picture
             is loaded.

        get [<file> [<date>]]
             Same as update, but ignores the locking.

        lock
             prevents subsequent updates from running. Useful if you
             have the script running as a cronjob but like today's
             picture so much.

        unlock
             removes the locking flag.

        wallpaper [<file>]
             set wallpaper on desktop.

automatic updates:
        Run the shell command "crontab -e" and add a line like:

        @hourly /home/cr/apod.sh update /home/cr/Images/apod.png 	              && /home/cr/apod.sh wallpaper /home/cr/Images/apod.png

        You may also use @daily or @reboot if your system is permanently
        online.
